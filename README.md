Key Benefits for Streamers:
Correct typos in viewer redeems automatically, matching "plae song" to "play song".
Minimize missed or incorrect chat redeems with smart string matching.
Quick integration into UE projects, enhancing streams without complex setup.
Tailor content based on chat trends and improve viewer engagement with accurate responses.

Features:
Substring Filter: Narrow down arrays by substring. Filter ["apple", "banana", "grape"] with "a" to get ["apple", "banana", "grape"].
Case-Insensitive Search: Broad and flexible matching that ignores case sensitivity.
Numeric Extraction: Pulls numeric characters from strings, turning "abc123def45" into "12345".
Number Detection: Identifies if a string contains numbers, returning True for "abc123" and False for "abcdef".
N-Gram Generation: Creates n-grams from strings for advanced text analysis, improving pattern recognition.

Ideal for Twitch streamers seeking to elevate chat interaction and redeem handling. Ensure viewer inputs are correctly interpreted and acted upon, boosting engagement and satisfaction.
